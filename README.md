# ESP32-IoT-button-graph-test
ESP32 recording button presses, and serving webpage that graphs the numbers over time.


Firmware was compiled from scratch in order to accomodate Websocket files into 4MB flash memory.

Need to find the website that showed me howto compile ESP32 firmware in Linux Mint  (Was not an easy task.  Lots of trial and error).

boot.py :	
	starts the show 
	Need to enable which Wifi script to run ---  AccessPoint or local Wifi network
	Next enable the pulse_detector.py script,  which starts the button press detection



#TODO : Need to further elaborate on the task at hand.
